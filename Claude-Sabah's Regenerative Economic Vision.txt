## Response:
Based on the documents, Forever Sabah's vision is:


A regenerative, circular economy for Sabah that replaces the current extractive, GDP-centric model with one guided by a holistic progress metric rooted in Sabahan values.


Core elements:


Economic transformation: From linear extraction to circular regeneration where resources flow in closed loops and nature is restored rather than depleted

Value redefinition: Moving beyond GDP to measure prosperity through indigenous concepts like mitatabang (collective spirit), reciprocity, responsibility, and trust between people and ecosystems

Power redistribution: Shifting from "participation without power" to genuine presence and co-creation, where Sabahans shape economic rules rather than just survive within them

Cultural restoration: Reviving place-based wisdom, languages, and kinship systems between people and more-than-human life that the extractive model has erased

Measurement revolution: A "Sabah Holistic Progress Index" co-designed by Sabahans themselves through mass listening technologies, serving as compass, mirror, and firewall against extractive development


The bottom line: Transform Sabah from a resource bank for external interests into a home where wellbeing is measured not by what's extracted, but by how deeply communities belong, how widely value is shared, and how wisely ecosystems are stewarded.

## Response:
Yes, absolutely understood. We're focusing on the holistic metric now.


And yes, you're right - a population survey is central to this project. But it's more than a traditional survey. The documents describe it as:


"Mass listening" using smartphone-based tech platform and AI to gather from a large sample of Sabahans across the state what they consider matters most for quality of life and livelihoods, plus how well they believe Sabah is currently performing in those domains.


Key survey elements planned:


Co-designed methodology - experimenting with visual, written, and oral formats to enable Sabahans to express what's important for their wellbeing

Different response formats - testing various kinds of scoring/response inputs back from participants

Two approaches being piloted:


Developing domains directly from people's views

Testing how Sabahans respond to pre-designated areas

Stratified sampling to control for bias and ensure representation across:


All locations, ethnicities, religions, walks of life

Using methods like stratified random sampling and social network-based sampling

Partnership approach - working with PACOS and other groups close to Sabah's diverse communities


The goal is to root the metric in "the experience of Sabahans themselves" rather than imposing external frameworks. So yes, the survey is essential, but it's designed as a participatory listening exercise rather than a conventional questionnaire.

Yes, you're absolutely right! Bhutan's Gross National Happiness is the most famous example, but there are several other places that have developed alternative metrics to GDP:


Key Examples:


National Level:


Bhutan - Gross National Happiness (GNH) Index with 9 domains: living standards, health, education, ecological diversity and resilience, cultural diversity and resilience, community vitality, time use, psychological wellbeing, and good governance

Philippines - Bills filed to adopt GNH principles

UAE - developing wellbeing measures


International Frameworks:


OECD Better Life Index - used by 35 OECD countries plus 3 non-OECD economies, covering 11 domains including housing, income, jobs, community, education, environment, civic engagement, health, life satisfaction, safety, and work-life balance

Happy Planet Index - measures sustainable wellbeing across 147+ countries by combining life expectancy, wellbeing, and ecological footprint


Sub-National Examples:


US States: Hawaii, Maryland, and Vermont have implemented Genuine Progress Indicators

Cities: Somerville (Massachusetts), Bristol (UK), Seattle (Washington), Eau Claire (Wisconsin), Creston (British Columbia)

Brazil: São Paulo state using GNH community-level versions


Other Notable Metrics:


Human Development Index (HDI) - UN measure focusing on health, education, and living standards

Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) - adjusts for environmental and social costs

Green GDP - factors in environmental damage costs


The movement gained significant momentum after the 2012 UN High-Level Meeting on "Happiness and Well-being: Defining a New Economic Paradigm" and the UN resolution declaring March 20 as International Day of Happiness.


For Sabah's project, these examples provide valuable precedents for developing locally-rooted metrics that capture what truly matters to communities beyond pure economic output.

Context (Root Causes & Consequences)
Sabah’s trajectory remains troublingly rooted in its formation under the British North Borneo 
Chartered Company, a profit-seeking speculative venture with an imperial charter that focused 
on generating revenue for shareholders while securing governability of native residents as 
empire subjects not citizens. Economic development has since focused on the needs of those 
associated with the state, while riding boom-and-bust cycles with little heed for their 
consequences on the ground.
Since incorporation into Malaysia, the extractive economy model has readily interwoven with 
patronage politics and social inequality. The state allocates natural resources and federal 
development budgets for sundry mega-projects, schemes and hand-outs, rather than as 
investment in any real economy for the people. The consequences have been dramatic. In 1970 
Sabah was the second richest state by per capita GDP in Malaysia. Decades of logging, oil palm 
and petrochemical development have driven accumulation and diversification outside of the 
state, and left Sabah the poorest in the federation. Furthermore, the 19.5% officially living in 
absolute poverty in Sabah suffer reduced access to the forests, fisheries and farmland that once 
sustained them. Approximately 75% of Sabah’s land has been allocated to production forest
concessions, oil palm estates (22%) and totally protected areas (27%), with around 10% of the 
state held under Native Title by the indigenous peoples who live in some 4,000 villages in the 
narrow gaps between these expropriated lands. Remote has become marginalised, and these 
communities increasingly find themselves forced to participate without power in a game of 
economic development that provides little and degrades much. Sabahans typically lived from 
and with rivers, mangroves and coastal reefs; with degraded forest watersheds, pollution and 
overfishing have become devastating. Native rights – including Customary Rights - provides 
scant protection to the latest extractive ventures around mining and energy (including megadams). 
One consequence of this poor governance and erosion of traditional livelihoods has been the 
unremitting struggle by Sabahans to enter the cash economy, and access state services, which 
are associated with all that is presented desirable about modern life. For large numbers this has 
meant labour migration – or emigration – to Sabah’s towns or stronger economies in Singapore 
and the Malay Peninsula, Australasia or the Middle East. Meanwhile those remaining in Sabah 
have become further embroiled in developmentalism, wherein government largesse becomes 
synonymous with growing GDP and better life, stripping away layers of culture, wisdom and 
complexity.

○ Infrastructure and services are tied to political loyalty, not human rights.
○ Women, elders, traditional custodians left out of formal decision-making.
3. Loss of Shared Meaning:
○ The dominance of a linear, extractive economic model (i.e. the GDP) has displaced 
Indigenous, relational, and place-based dimensions of wellbeing. 
○ Youth are leaving (brain drain), languages are disappearing, and community 
identities are fraying (loss of identity, spiritual connection to land). 
○ The current economic model is one that lays emphasis on value but forgoes 
meaning.
Problem statement 
Sabah’s dominant development model is extractive, GDP-centric and blind to relational and 
ecological wellbeing, forcing communities into participation without power, ignores indigenous 
systems of value, and accelerates cultural, ecological, and social disintegration.
Root causes
1. Colonial Legacy and Extractive Foundations
● Infrastructure, legal systems, and land tenure reflect colonial priorities.
● Modernisation is associated with erasing traditional systems.
2. Political Patronage and Corruption
● Public goods and infrastructure are politicized, weaponised.
● Resource access and economic opportunity are tied to elite networks.
3. Centralised, Fragmented Governance
● Rural voices are excluded from development planning.
● Siloed departments and short-term planning cycles hinder systemic reform.
4. Distorted Value Systems
● GDP is the only lens of success – sacred ecologies, collective labor, and emotional 
wellbeing are undervalued.
● Traditional economies are painted as backward or irrelevant.
5. Historical Amnesia and Victim-Entitlement Dynamics
● Lack of reckoning with colonial trauma, marginalisation, and federal extraction 
creates cycles of apathy and dependency.
6. State-Federal Imbalance
● Sabah is treated as a resource bank, not a co-equal partner in development.
● Control over land, education, and fiscal resources is centralized.
Consequences
1. Ecological Breakdown
● Deforestation, biodiversity collapse, water crisis, and soil erosion.


Response


Sharpening the Vision  Ashoka Accelerator  22May2025.pdf
● Rising climate disasters and loss of carbon/nature-based assets.
2. Cultural and Social Fragmentation
● Erasure of languages, rituals, and ancestral knowledge systems.
● Youth alienation, community disconnection, and rise in urban precarity.
3. Entrenched Inequality and Disempowerment
● Loss of intergenerational agency, rise in political apathy and disenfranchisement.
● Talent and youth migration, weakening of rural resilience.
4. Economic Fragility
● Boom-and-bust cycles from reliance on palm oil, timber, fossil fuels.
● Collapse of local food systems and over-dependence on imports.
5. Loss of Regenerative Opportunity
● Missing the window to reorient Sabah’s economy and governance while there is 
still ecological and cultural wealth to build upon.
Overall Vision
● A regenerative and relational Sabah where wellbeing is not measured by how much is 
extracted, but by how deeply communities belong, how widely value is shared, how wisely 
ecosystems are cared for – what is taken is returned.
● An index that serves as:
○ A mirror reflecting what mainstream development erases/has erased,
○ A guiding compass for reciprocity, trust, responsibility, etc,
○ A firewall against extractive development in disguise,
○ A seed bank for collective flourishing.

For large numbers this has 
meant labour migration – or emigration – to Sabah’s towns or stronger economies in Singapore 
and the Malay Peninsula, Australasia or the Middle East. Meanwhile those remaining in Sabah 
have become further embroiled in developmentalism, wherein government largesse becomes 
synonymous with growing GDP and better life, stripping away layers of culture, wisdom and 
complexity. Government-sponsored efforts to liquidate the state’s natural capital for sundry 
projects thus meet on the forest edge with desperate efforts by marginalised locals to survive, 
perhaps by hunting pangolins for export, in a breakdown of stewardship and biodiversity endgame. Sabah’s politics become trapped in federal victimhood rather than the responsibilities of 
sovereignty. 
In Sabah, ecological, livelihood and biodiversity loss is inseparable from the erosion of cultural 
identities and values rooted in ancestral relationship with land and sea. As forests fall and 
ecosystems degrade, we are not only losing species—we are losing languages, traditions, and 
lifeways that hold generations of place-based wisdom. This loss extends beyond the human 
realm. It severs the deep kinships between people and more-than-human life, unravelling 
systems of mutual care that have long sustained us, built on diversity and reciprocity. The 
dominant extractive model not only strips the land of life, but erases the voices and relationships 
that define it. But this is where there is an important crack in the system and an opening in 
Sabah, for there remains an irrepressible constituency for sustaining collective spirit (mitatabang) 
and for locally-rooted environmentalism; these are vital epicentres for civil society agency, 
creativity and initiative.

Forever Sabah/Ashoka Accelerator – Sprint 1 29 May 2025
Problem & Vision Statement
Sabah’s development model and direction is rooted in and shaped by its colonial history; joining 
Malaysia in a dynamic of subservience then extended the trajectory of the linear, extractive 
economy powered by patronage politics and social inequality. The vast majority of the state’s 
rich resources are in service of this system, whilst a sliver is where most Sabahans are allowed 
to seek livelihoods; this deepens the divides and widens the disconnect in the social, economic 
and ecological landscape.
Forever Sabah envisions a diversified, equitable, *circular economy for Sabah, Malaysian 
Borneo. This regenerative economy is oriented by a holistic metric as compass and thought 
leadership for guiding and tracking progress and prosperity beyond GDP (Gross Domestic 
Product – a monetary measure of economic performance). These metrics are composed of 
indicators and domains shaped by Sabahan values, and better reflect their generosity, 
reciprocity, responsibility and trust, both among people and between society, and our natural and 
cultural heritage.
* The circular economy is a system where nature is regenerative and resources are utilised in a 
closed loop (e.g. bioplastics made from wood waste).
Current Mission
Forever Sabah’s mission is to co-create new pathways, practices and policies for renewal and 
regeneration across sectors and society, and ignite impetus for systems change in the focal areas of 
Food, Agriculture & Fisheries, Forests Water & Soil, Energy, Infrastructure & Waste, Livelihoods, 
Enterprise & Tourism, and Culture & Arts. Our strategies in realising this mission are:
Engage in and enable *relational and 
collaborative processes across all 
sectors in Sabah and beyond
* building relational tissue and 
capacity that humanizes and decenters solutionizing and 
transactionality
Co-design and co-initiate 
prototypes, projects and 
programs where there are 
openings and readiness to 
disrupt patterns and habits 
in the current linear, 
extractive economy
Facilitate, convene and build 
spaces for generative, creative 
and open dialogue where 
shared concerns, issues and 
aspirations are discussed 
in ways that build 
trust and traction

Holistic Metric - design & process
Forever Sabah envisions a diversified, equitable, circular economy for Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. This 
regenerative economy is oriented by a holistic metric as compass and thought leadership for guiding 
and tracking progress and prosperity beyond GDP.
Our intention is to generate the "Sabah Holistic Progress Index/Indicators/Metric" as rooted in the 
experience of Sabahans themselves; doing this requires new technologies of “mass listening”. To 
this end, Forever Sabah will co-design, co-pilot and then socialise ways to use a smartphone based 
tech platform and AI to gather and synthesise from a large sample of Sabahans across the state what 
they consider matters most for the quality of their lives and livelihoods, and then to benchmark how 
well they believe the state is currently performing in each of those domains.
In order to develop methods for easily but deeply enabling Sabahans to express what is important 
for their wellbeing, we will experiment with a range of visual, written and oral formats and prompts, 
and test the consequences of requesting different kinds of response/scoring inputs back from them. 
Some pilots may also assess ways to develop domains of concern directly from the views of the 
people, while others see how Sabahans respond and value different pre-designated areas. In 
addition to learning how to structure the metric, and how our people measure and “score”, we 
believe this exercise will teach us much about how Sabahans approach visioning and communicating 
their hopes for progress in the state.
Roll-out itself will require methodologies to control credibly for different kinds of sampling bias, 
while exploring empathetically any major differences among categories of Sabahans about what 
they value. The pilot phase will therefore explore methods for stratified random sampling, social 
network based sampling, and other methods to ensure all locations, ethnicities, religions, and walks 
of life can be properly heard, and analysed representationally and objectively.
The pilot phase will rely much on partnerships with PACOS and other groups that are close to 
Sabah’s diverse communities. In addition to ongoing stakeholder consultations a gathering of key 
actors for the Metric – to include the state government, the state legislative assembly, research 
institutions, civil society and even the Ministry of Finance – will review the findings from the pilot 
phase prior to roll-out of the actual metric.

Bhutan_GNH_2022_(2023)_compressed.pdf
By measuring these and other factors, the
GNH Index provides a more comprehensive and holistic picture of the
quality of life in a country than traditional economic measures like GDP.
The GNH Index values sustainability
One of the drawbacks of using GDP as a measure of economic progress
is that it does not indicate whether the country's rate of growth is
sustainable. GDP does not consider whether this economic growth is
being achieved in a way that is socially, economically, and
environmentally sustainable over the long term. For example, a country
that achieves high GDP growth by depleting its natural resources,
contributing to green gas emissions or exploiting its workers may be
unsustainable in the long run, even if its GDP growth rate is high in the

GNH 2022
130
short term. Similarly, a country that achieves high GDP growth but
where societal physical and mental health is deteriorating over time
may be unsustainable in the long run, even if its GDP growth rate is high
in the short term.
In contrast, the GNH Index values sustainability as one of its key
principles. It is based on the principle that sustainable development and
the wellbeing of people and the planet should be valued over economic
growth. The nine domains of the GNH Index are designed to reflect a
balance between material, social, and environmental wellbeing, all of
which are considered important for achieving sustainable development.
The ecological diversity and resilience and cultural diversity and
resilience domains, for example, focus on environmental sustainability
and the ability of communities to adapt to change. The community
vitality domain focuses on social sustainability and the importance of
social capital and community resilience. In addition, the GNH Index also
recognises the importance of intergenerational equity and the need to
balance the needs of current and future generations. The Index helps to
identify areas where policies and investments may be needed to
promote wellbeing in a more comprehensive and sustainable way.
The GNH Index takes into account non-market transactions
Another limitation of GDP is that it does not account for non-market
transactions. Non-market transactions are activities that are not
exchanged for money in the formal market, such as household chores,
childcare, elderly care, and volunteer work. Since these activities are not
recorded in the official economic statistics, they are not included in GDP.
They can, nevertheless, make significant contributions to a nation's
prosperity and standard of living. For instance, home activities like
cooking, cleaning, and childrearing, can have a large positive impact on
individuals and families.
Moreover, certain non-market transactions might take the place of some
market transactions, which could cause an overestimation of economic
activity.

Context/Framing Ideas *needs some work – whole of Sabah?
1. “Ekos” as Home: Economy as Access, Belonging, and Presence
We begin with the etymological root of ‘economy’ from the Greek word oikos, meaning ‘home’,
allowing us to dive deeper – the linear economic model builds a home with one main entrance 
(cash participation), excluding those who live sustainably, relationally, or collectively outside the 
system. 
2. Multiple Doorways
In indigenous and rural Sabah communities, value is meaningful and generated through the 
communal/collective spirit of mitatabang. Mitatabang is more than tradition – it’s a way of life. It is 
the quiet strength of neighbors harvesting rice together, the shared laughter of elders teaching 
ancient skills inherited from their ancestors, and the deep-rooted bond between people and land 
– capturing connection, purpose, and resilience. Prosperity flows like the rivers, seasons, and the 
hands that sustain each other–always shared, always renewing, always enough.
*may add a piece on gotong-royong (communal kinship), intergenerational care, ecosystem 
kinship – all of which are economies of wellbeing that are invisible to mainstream metrics.
These are not nostalgic alternatives. They are living, breathing, functional systems of care and 
regeneration. *the unbanked rich, a treasury of things that breathe
3. Presence vs Participation
For most Sabahans, participation in the cash economy is dull and lacks meaning (if there is any, 
really). They cannot shape rules, policies, or outcomes. Presence in this sense implies dignity, 
agency, and co-creation. If the cash economy is a home, whose home is it? Who has the key? 
Who is allowed to hang paintings and rearrange furniture? In other words, who has the power to 
be truly present – to be seen, heard, felt and to move the economy? 
Wealth distribution is often concerned with slicing the pie more fairly, but power distribution is 
asking who decides the recipe. It is the factor that determines what and who the economy is for, 
how value is defined, exchanged, and stewarded. 
*centering voice, autonomy, consent, etc..?
Where we are today 
Sabah is rich in biodiversity, cultural heritage, and community knowledge systems – yet these are 
under siege. We are living through:
1. Ecological instability 
○ Accelerating deforestation, biodiversity loss, climate-related disasters, watershed 
degradation, etc.
○ Natural systems treated as resource banks for short-term gains.
○ Sacred ecologies reduced to commodities.
2. Social inequity
○ Widening gaps between urban and rural, structural marginalisation of Indigenous 
and stateless groups, and disempowerment through patronage politics.





Based on the project documents, here are the key focus areas for Sabah's holistic metric survey and how they should differ from Bhutan's approach:


Sabah's Core Survey Focus Areas:


1. Relational & Collective Wellbeing


Mitatabang (collective spirit) - measuring community solidarity and mutual support

Gotong-royong (communal kinship) - assessing reciprocal care systems

Intergenerational relationships - connection between elders and youth

Ecosystem kinship - relationship with more-than-human life


2. Presence vs. Participation


Agency & voice - ability to shape economic decisions vs. just surviving within them

Co-creation power - capacity to influence development policies

Dignity in economic participation - meaningful vs. extractive engagement

Autonomy & consent - control over traditional territories and resources


3. Cultural & Linguistic Vitality


Language preservation - addressing rapid language loss

Ancestral knowledge systems - maintaining place-based wisdom

Traditional livelihood practices - sustainable resource management

Sacred ecology connections - spiritual relationships with land/sea


4. Regenerative Economics


Circular economy participation - closed-loop resource systems

Local food security - reducing import dependency

Sustainable livelihood diversity - beyond boom-bust cycles

Resource stewardship - caring for vs. extracting from ecosystems


5. Youth Retention & Opportunity


Meaningful local opportunities - alternatives to migration

Skills for regenerative economy - preparing for post-extractive livelihoods

Cultural identity resilience - maintaining connection while engaging modernity

Leadership pathways - youth voice in decision-making


Key Differences from Bhutan's GNH:

Aspect
Bhutan GNH
Sabah Metric
Context
Buddhist philosophy, relatively intact culture
Post-colonial trauma, active cultural erosion
Primary Challenge
Balancing tradition with modernization
Reversing extractive patterns, stopping brain drain
Economic Focus
Sustainable development within existing systems
Circular economy transition from linear extraction
Governance
Sovereign nation with policy control
Federated state with limited autonomy
Cultural Frame
Preserving established Buddhist values
Reviving and strengthening Indigenous systems
Urgency
Gradual, preventive approach
Crisis response - rapid ecological/cultural loss

Sabah-Specific Survey Questions Should Address:


Power & Participation:


Do you feel heard in decisions affecting your community's future?

Can you practice traditional livelihoods without interference?

Are young people staying or leaving your community?


Regenerative Practices:


How healthy are the forests/waters you depend on?

Are traditional stewardship practices valued and supported?

Can you meet daily needs through local, sustainable means?


Cultural Continuity:


Are your languages and traditions being passed to youth?

Do you feel connected to your ancestral lands/waters?

Are elders' knowledge systems recognized and valued?


Economic Alternatives:


Do you have access to meaningful work beyond palm oil/logging?

Can you participate in economic decisions affecting your area?

Are there pathways for youth that don't require leaving Sabah?


The key is that Sabah's metric must be explicitly decolonizing and regenerative - not just measuring happiness within existing systems, but actively supporting the transition from extractive to circular economics while strengthening Indigenous knowledge systems and community agency.

## Response:
Looking at both Bhutan's survey and the Sabah-specific challenges, here's my analysis:


Bhutan's 9 Core Domains:


Psychological Wellbeing - Life satisfaction, stress, spirituality, emotions

Health - Physical/mental health, healthcare access, lifestyle factors

Time Use & Balance - Work-life balance, time allocation

Education - Formal education, cultural literacy, skills

Cultural Diversity & Resilience - Language, traditions, values, identity

Good Governance - Political participation, trust in institutions, corruption

Community Vitality - Social connections, volunteering, safety, trust

Ecological Diversity & Resilience - Environmental connection, conservation behaviors

Living Standards - Income, housing, assets, financial security


What Sabah Should Keep from Bhutan's Survey:


Essential Sections:


Demographics (age, gender, occupation, education)

Psychological Wellbeing - but adapt stress sources and happiness factors

Health - basic health status and healthcare access

Community Vitality - social connections and mutual support systems

Cultural Identity - language preservation and traditional practices

Governance - trust in institutions and political participation

Living Standards - income and basic needs satisfaction


What Sabah Should DROP/Modify:


Less Relevant for Sabah:


Detailed Buddhist spirituality questions (karma, meditation frequency, etc.)

Bhutan-specific cultural elements (driglam namzha, dzongkha literacy)

Time diary section (too detailed for initial survey)

Extensive asset ownership lists (livestock types specific to Bhutan)


What Sabah MUST ADD Based on Context:


Brain Drain & Migration:


Intent to leave Sabah (1-10 scale)

What would make you stay?

Do you encourage young people to leave for opportunities?

Connection to ancestral lands despite economic pressures


Resource Extraction & Sustainability:


Satisfaction with palm oil industry's impact on community

Trust in environmental protection measures

Access to traditional forest resources vs. conservation areas

Impact of extractive industries on daily life


Economic Agency & Power:


Do you feel you have a voice in economic decisions affecting your community?

Can you practice traditional livelihoods sustainably?

Access to non-extractive economic opportunities


Indigenous Knowledge & Rights:


Mitatabang (collective spirit) practices and strength

Traditional ecological knowledge transmission

Land tenure security and customary rights

Intergenerational knowledge transfer


Federal-State Relations:


Satisfaction with Sabah's treatment within Malaysia

Resource revenue sharing fairness

Autonomy in local decision-making


Sabah-Specific Survey Domains I'd Recommend:


Personal Wellbeing (adapted from Bhutan's psychological wellbeing)

Health & Healthcare Access

Economic Agency & Opportunity (broader than just living standards)

Cultural Vitality & Language Preservation

Community Resilience (mitatabang, gotong-royong)

Environmental Stewardship (beyond Bhutan's ecological focus)

Governance & Participation (local and federal levels)

Place Attachment & Migration Intentions (unique to brain drain context)

Resource Justice (unique to extractive economy context)


Key insight: Sabah's survey should be shorter but more targeted - focusing on the specific tensions between traditional values, economic pressures, environmental degradation, and the desire for young people to stay and build lives rooted in place rather than seeking opportunities elsewhere.


The survey needs to capture not just current satisfaction but potential for regenerative futures - what would need to change for Sabah to become a place where young people choose to stay and thrive?

Bhutan_GNH_2022_(2023)_compressed.pdf
Survey coverage
The 2022 GNH survey, like past GNH surveys, is designed to cover the
entire country which is divided into 20 dzongkhags. Each dzongkhag is
divided into rural and urban areas and is further sub-divided into
Enumeration Areas (EA). Chiwogs in rural and enumeration blocks in
urban areas is used as a Primary Sampling Unit (PSU). The target
population included those aged 15 years or older.
Sample design
The sample for the 2022 GNH survey is designed to provide estimates
of GNH-related indicators representative at national, rural and urban
areas, and dzongkhag levels. A stratified three-stage sampling design
is adopted. Two mutually exclusive sampling frames – rural and urban
areas were used.
56 
Urban and rural areas within each dzongkhag have
been identified as the main sampling strata.
The first stage sample selection involved selection of PSUs which are
chiwogs in rural and enumeration blocks in urban areas. The PSUs in
both rural and urban areas are selected using Probability Proportional
56 
All Thromdes (urban centres), Dzongkhag Headquarters, and satellite towns
designated as ‘urban’ by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS)
were considered as urban areas and all the rest as rural areas for this study. A place
that meets four out of the following five criteria is considered ‘urban’ by the MoWHS:
i) a minimum population of 1,500 people; ii) a population density of 1,000 people or
more per square kilometre; iii) more than 50% of the population should depend on
non-primary activities; iv) the area of the urban centre should not be less than 1.5
square kilometres; and v) potential for future growth of the urban centre particularly
in terms of its revenue base.

to Size (PPS) method where number of households is used as measure
of size (MOS) variable.
Households within the selected PSUs formed the Secondary Sampling
Units (SSUs). Therefore, the second stage sample selection involved
selecting households as SSUs from within the selected PSUs. The
required number of households from the selected PSUs were selected
using Circular Systematic Sampling (CSS) approach.
Finally, the third stage sample selection involved the selection of
individuals as Ultimate Sampling Units (USUs) from the selected
households. Selection of a household member from the selected
households was done using the Kish grid selection method.
Sampling frame
The sampling frame for the survey is constructed using number of
households reported by the National Statistics Bureau (NSB) based on
the Population and Housing Census of Bhutan (PHCB) conducted in
2017. The household listing for the selected PSUs was updated before
the selection of household samples. For effective implementation of
area sampling, the field supervisors and assistant supervisors were
trained extensively on area sampling methods before leaving for the
field survey.

Context (Root Causes & Consequences)
Sabah’s trajectory remains troublingly rooted in its formation under the British North Borneo 
Chartered Company, a profit-seeking speculative venture with an imperial charter that focused 
on generating revenue for shareholders while securing governability of native residents as 
empire subjects not citizens. Economic development has since focused on the needs of those 
associated with the state, while riding boom-and-bust cycles with little heed for their 
consequences on the ground.
Since incorporation into Malaysia, the extractive economy model has readily interwoven with 
patronage politics and social inequality. The state allocates natural resources and federal 
development budgets for sundry mega-projects, schemes and hand-outs, rather than as 
investment in any real economy for the people. The consequences have been dramatic. In 1970 
Sabah was the second richest state by per capita GDP in Malaysia. Decades of logging, oil palm 
and petrochemical development have driven accumulation and diversification outside of the 
state, and left Sabah the poorest in the federation. Furthermore, the 19.5% officially living in 
absolute poverty in Sabah suffer reduced access to the forests, fisheries and farmland that once 
sustained them. Approximately 75% of Sabah’s land has been allocated to production forest
concessions, oil palm estates (22%) and totally protected areas (27%), with around 10% of the 
state held under Native Title by the indigenous peoples who live in some 4,000 villages in the 
narrow gaps between these expropriated lands. Remote has become marginalised, and these 
communities increasingly find themselves forced to participate without power in a game of 
economic development that provides little and degrades much. Sabahans typically lived from 
and with rivers, mangroves and coastal reefs; with degraded forest watersheds, pollution and 
overfishing have become devastating. Native rights – including Customary Rights - provides 
scant protection to the latest extractive ventures around mining and energy (including megadams). 
One consequence of this poor governance and erosion of traditional livelihoods has been the 
unremitting struggle by Sabahans to enter the cash economy, and access state services, which 
are associated with all that is presented desirable about modern life. For large numbers this has 
meant labour migration – or emigration – to Sabah’s towns or stronger economies in Singapore 
and the Malay Peninsula, Australasia or the Middle East. Meanwhile those remaining in Sabah 
have become further embroiled in developmentalism, wherein government largesse becomes 
synonymous with growing GDP and better life, stripping away layers of culture, wisdom and 
complexity.

● Rising climate disasters and loss of carbon/nature-based assets.
2. Cultural and Social Fragmentation
● Erasure of languages, rituals, and ancestral knowledge systems.
● Youth alienation, community disconnection, and rise in urban precarity.
3. Entrenched Inequality and Disempowerment
● Loss of intergenerational agency, rise in political apathy and disenfranchisement.
● Talent and youth migration, weakening of rural resilience.
4. Economic Fragility
● Boom-and-bust cycles from reliance on palm oil, timber, fossil fuels.
● Collapse of local food systems and over-dependence on imports.
5. Loss of Regenerative Opportunity
● Missing the window to reorient Sabah’s economy and governance while there is 
still ecological and cultural wealth to build upon.
Overall Vision
● A regenerative and relational Sabah where wellbeing is not measured by how much is 
extracted, but by how deeply communities belong, how widely value is shared, how wisely 
ecosystems are cared for – what is taken is returned.
● An index that serves as:
○ A mirror reflecting what mainstream development erases/has erased,
○ A guiding compass for reciprocity, trust, responsibility, etc,
○ A firewall against extractive development in disguise,
○ A seed bank for collective flourishing.

Sharpening the Vision  Ashoka Accelerator  22May2025.pdf
○ Infrastructure and services are tied to political loyalty, not human rights.
○ Women, elders, traditional custodians left out of formal decision-making.
3. Loss of Shared Meaning:
○ The dominance of a linear, extractive economic model (i.e. the GDP) has displaced 
Indigenous, relational, and place-based dimensions of wellbeing. 
○ Youth are leaving (brain drain), languages are disappearing, and community 
identities are fraying (loss of identity, spiritual connection to land). 
○ The current economic model is one that lays emphasis on value but forgoes 
meaning.
Problem statement 
Sabah’s dominant development model is extractive, GDP-centric and blind to relational and 
ecological wellbeing, forcing communities into participation without power, ignores indigenous 
systems of value, and accelerates cultural, ecological, and social disintegration.
Root causes
1. Colonial Legacy and Extractive Foundations
● Infrastructure, legal systems, and land tenure reflect colonial priorities.
● Modernisation is associated with erasing traditional systems.
2. Political Patronage and Corruption
● Public goods and infrastructure are politicized, weaponised.
● Resource access and economic opportunity are tied to elite networks.
3. Centralised, Fragmented Governance
● Rural voices are excluded from development planning.
● Siloed departments and short-term planning cycles hinder systemic reform.
4. Distorted Value Systems
● GDP is the only lens of success – sacred ecologies, collective labor, and emotional 
wellbeing are undervalued.
● Traditional economies are painted as backward or irrelevant.
5. Historical Amnesia and Victim-Entitlement Dynamics
● Lack of reckoning with colonial trauma, marginalisation, and federal extraction 
creates cycles of apathy and dependency.
6. State-Federal Imbalance
● Sabah is treated as a resource bank, not a co-equal partner in development.
● Control over land, education, and fiscal resources is centralized.
Consequences
1. Ecological Breakdown
● Deforestation, biodiversity collapse, water crisis, and soil erosion.

It took four months to complete the in-
person interviews (April to July 2022). CBS conducted the 2022 survey
using a rigorous data gathering, entry, and cleaning method. A survey
manual guide was also created to assist with data gathering.
How many people did the GNH survey 2022 cover?
The GNH survey in 2022 had a sample size of 11,440 people aged 15
and above. To match with national proportions, 73% (8,400) were
identified from rural areas, while the remaining 27% (3,040) were
identified from urban areas. The response rate was high at 96.6%
(11,052).

What kind of sampling design was used for the 2022 GNH
survey?
A multi-stage stratified sampling methodology was used to ensure that
the sample was representative at the national, regional and district
levels. Similar to the previous surveys, rural and urban areas were used
as the main sampling strata. The areas were further classified into
Enumeration Areas (EA). The Primary Sampling Units (PSU) were
identified as chiwog for rural and enumeration block for urban. A
sampling frame was created based on the 2017 Population and

This can involve things like extending early voting hours,
permitting same-day voter registration, and offering mail-in voting
choices. Policies that support political education can serve to boost civic
awareness and engagement. Similarly, efforts such as mandating civics
education in schools, offering voter education materials are examples of
such efforts.
In general, the 33 indicators appear to be relevant for the time being,
but they may need to be revisited in the future to fully reflect the
challenges and circumstances associated with growing economic and
social trends and causes. With rising emigration to Australia, for
example, one could want to include an employment indicator to capture
information on job opportunities in the country. Similarly, as literacy
rates rise, literacy indicator may become obsolete. Therefore, for the
GNH Index to successfully monitor the country's wellbeing and
happiness, the relevancy and validity of the indicators may need to be
examined with time.
The publication of this book might be an important first step in
increasing awareness of the GNH Index and the changes overtime.
Additional advocacy campaigns, workshops, and awareness
programmes aimed at policymakers, civil society groups, and the
general public, on the other hand, can help achieve this goal even
further. More people will understand the benefits of the GNH Index and
be more supportive of its implementation.
Bhutan can also continue to promote the GNH approach to development
and encourage other nations to adopt similar frameworks that prioritise
the wellbeing of their population by sharing the GNH Index with other
countries. Furthermore, disseminating the GNH Index can promote
international cooperation and collaboration. Countries may learn from
each other's experiences, share best practices, and discover innovative
solutions to common difficulties by working together to promote
wellbeing and sustainable development. This can also serve to
strengthen international ties.
Here at home, considerable work needs to be done in order to fully
utilise the findings from the GNH Index. The GNH Index needs to be

The 2022 GNH survey, like past GNH surveys, is designed to cover the
entire country which is divided into 20 dzongkhags. Each dzongkhag is

For large numbers this has 
meant labour migration – or emigration – to Sabah’s towns or stronger economies in Singapore 
and the Malay Peninsula, Australasia or the Middle East. Meanwhile those remaining in Sabah 
have become further embroiled in developmentalism, wherein government largesse becomes 
synonymous with growing GDP and better life, stripping away layers of culture, wisdom and 
complexity. Government-sponsored efforts to liquidate the state’s natural capital for sundry 
projects thus meet on the forest edge with desperate efforts by marginalised locals to survive, 
perhaps by hunting pangolins for export, in a breakdown of stewardship and biodiversity endgame. Sabah’s politics become trapped in federal victimhood rather than the responsibilities of 
sovereignty. 
In Sabah, ecological, livelihood and biodiversity loss is inseparable from the erosion of cultural 
identities and values rooted in ancestral relationship with land and sea. As forests fall and 
ecosystems degrade, we are not only losing species—we are losing languages, traditions, and 
lifeways that hold generations of place-based wisdom. This loss extends beyond the human 
realm. It severs the deep kinships between people and more-than-human life, unravelling 
systems of mutual care that have long sustained us, built on diversity and reciprocity. The 
dominant extractive model not only strips the land of life, but erases the voices and relationships 
that define it. But this is where there is an important crack in the system and an opening in 
Sabah, for there remains an irrepressible constituency for sustaining collective spirit (mitatabang) 
and for locally-rooted environmentalism; these are vital epicentres for civil society agency, 
creativity and initiative.





Based on the project documents and Bhutan's methodology, here's how I'd frame Sabah's Holistic Progress Survey parameters:


Survey Framework: "Sabah Voices - Regenerative Futures Survey"


Core Philosophy:


"Mass listening technology to root the metric in Sabahan experience" - moving from extractive data collection to regenerative dialogue that honors participant knowledge.



SAMPLING STRATEGY


Target Population:


Age: 18+ (adult decision-makers)

Coverage: All of Sabah's 25 districts

Size: ~8,000-10,000 respondents (manageable but representative)


Stratified Sampling Approach:


Primary Strata:


Geographic: Urban (20%) / Rural (60%) / Remote indigenous communities (20%)

Ethnic: Reflecting Sabah's diversity (Kadazan-Dusun, Bajau, Murut, Chinese, Malay, others)

Economic: Palm oil/logging dependent vs. diversified livelihoods vs. subsistence

Age cohorts: 18-25 (brain drain focus) / 26-45 (economic prime) / 46+ (traditional knowledge)


Sampling Method:


Stage 1: District selection (all 25 districts)

Stage 2: Village/community selection (partnership with PACOS for indigenous communities)

Stage 3: Household selection (systematic random sampling)

Stage 4: Individual selection (Kish grid method)



SURVEY MODALITIES


Multi-Modal Approach:


Digital Platform: Smartphone-based with offline capability

Visual Formats: Photo prompts, emoji scales, mapping exercises

Oral Formats: Audio recording for storytelling sections

Written Formats: Traditional Likert scales for quantitative data


Language Options:


Bahasa Malaysia (primary)

English (urban/educated)

Kadazan-Dusun

Bajau

Audio translation support for other indigenous languages



SURVEY STRUCTURE & LENGTH


Total Time: 45-60 minutes (shorter than Bhutan's 3 hours)

Visioning Exercise: "Draw/describe Sabah in 20 years if everything went right"


Scoring Innovation:


Current Performance: How is Sabah doing now? (1-10)

Importance Weight: How important is this to you? (1-5)

Future Potential: How much could this improve? (1-5)


AI-Supported Analysis:


Qualitative Coding: AI to identify themes in open responses

Sentiment Analysis: Emotional tone across domains

Pattern Recognition: Unexpected correlations between domains



IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERSHIP


Community Partners:


PACOS for indigenous community access

Local NGOs for urban/rural networks

Religious organizations for cultural sensitivity

Youth organizations for brain drain insights


Government Engagement:


State Legislative Assembly review before full rollout

District officers for logistical support

Ministry of Finance for policy relevance


Quality Assurance:


Pre-testing in 3 diverse communities

Enumerator training in cultural sensitivity

Data validation through community feedback sessions

Bias checking across demographic groups



TIMELINE


Pilot Phase: 3 months (500 respondents)

Full Survey: 6 months (8,000 respondents)

Analysis & Report: 3 months

Community Feedback: 2 months


This approach honors the complexity of Sabahan identity while generating actionable data for regenerative development. The key is listening rather than extracting - making participants feel heard rather than studied.

## Key Differences from Bhutan's GNH:

- **Place Attachment & Migration:** Directly addresses brain drain - not relevant in Bhutan's context
- **Economic Agency:** Focuses on power/voice, not just standard of living
- **Resource Justice:** Addresses colonial/extractive legacy - unique to resource-rich but poor regions
- **Community Resilience:** Centers indigenous concepts like *mitatabang* rather than Buddhist values
- **Environmental Stewardship:** Emphasizes relationship and rights, not just conservation

## Integration Principles:

- **Holistic:** All domains interconnect - you can't have personal wellbeing without community resilience
- **Regenerative:** Measures capacity for renewal, not just current state
- **Culturally Rooted:** Based on Sabahan values like *mitatabang*, not external frameworks
- **Power-Aware:** Recognizes difference between participation (being included) and presence (having voice)
- **Future-Oriented:** Measures potential for transformation, not just current satisfaction


I've created a comprehensive table showing Sabah's 9 domains framework. The key insight is that 3 of these domains are unique to Sabah's context and wouldn't be found in Bhutan's GNH:


Place Attachment & Migration - directly addresses the brain drain crisis

Economic Agency - goes beyond income to measure actual economic power and voice

Resource Justice - tackles the core issue of being resource-rich but people-poor


The other 6 domains adapt universal concepts (health, culture, environment, etc.) but with Sabahan characteristics - like centering mitatabang in Community Resilience rather than Buddhist concepts.


This framework serves as both mirror and compass - showing what's been erased by extractive development while pointing toward regenerative alternatives rooted in Sabahan values.

## Response:
You're absolutely right! Education and business development are critical gaps. Let me refine this to be more comprehensive and crisp.

| **9. Governance & Justice** | Voice, fairness, resource distribution | • Political participation & trust<br>• Resource revenue sharing<br>• Land tenure security<br>• Corruption & transparency | **RESOURCE JUSTICE:** Do Sabahans control their own development? |

## Key Design Principles:

### **Crisp Focus Areas:**
1. **Brain Drain** (Place Attachment) - Why do people leave?
2. **Skills Gap** (Learning & Skills) - Education for what economy?
3. **Business Climate** (Economic Opportunity) - Can entrepreneurs thrive?
4. **Cultural Erosion** (Cultural Vitality) - What's being lost?
5. **Community Breakdown** (Community Resilience) - Is *mitatabang* alive?
6. **Environmental Degradation** (Environmental Health) - Can nature heal?
7. **Service Gaps** (Health & Services) - Do basics work?
8. **Power Imbalance** (Governance & Justice) - Who controls Sabah's future?

### **Integration Logic:**
- **Foundation Layer:** Personal Wellbeing + Health & Services (individual basics)
- **Economic Layer:** Learning & Skills + Economic Opportunity (livelihood capacity)  
- **Social Layer:** Cultural Vitality + Community Resilience (collective strength)
- **Governance Layer:** Environmental Health + Governance & Justice (systemic power)
- **Retention Layer:** Place Attachment (synthesis - do people want to stay?)

### **Measurement Approach:**
- **Current State:** How are we doing now? (1-10)
- **Importance:** How much does this matter? (1-5) 
- **Potential:** How much could this improve? (1-5)
- **Action:** What would help most? (open-ended)


Perfect! I've made the framework much more crisp and comprehensive by:


Key Changes:


Added Missing Critical Areas:


Learning & Skills - addresses education relevance and skills for future economy

Economic Opportunity - specifically tackles business environment and entrepreneurship


Made More Focused:


Combined resource justice into broader "Governance & Justice"

Merged environmental aspects into "Environmental Health"

Streamlined each domain to 3-4 core indicators max


Added Integration Logic:


The domains now flow in logical layers:


Individual Foundation (wellbeing + health)

Economic Capacity (skills + opportunities)

Social Fabric (culture + community)

Systemic Power (environment + governance)

Retention Synthesis (place attachment as the ultimate measure)


The Big Questions Each Domain Answers:


Are people personally thriving? (Personal Wellbeing)

Do people want to stay in Sabah? (Place Attachment)

Are we learning for the right economy? (Learning & Skills)

Can businesses thrive beyond extraction? (Economic Opportunity)

Are cultures alive and evolving? (Cultural Vitality)

Is community spirit (mitatabang) strong? (Community Resilience)

Is the environment healing or degrading? (Environmental Health)

Do basic services work for everyone? (Health & Services)

Who really controls Sabah's future? (Governance & Justice)


This framework now captures both the crisis (brain drain, extractive economy) and the opportunity (regenerative development) while being tight enough to actually implement.

## Response:
Exactly! You've hit on something crucial. Place Attachment isn't really a separate domain - it's the outcome indicator that synthesizes all the other layers.


Think of it like this:


Place Attachment as the Ultimate Metric


Place Attachment = f(Foundation + Economic + Social + Governance)


If someone has:


✅ Strong foundation (personal wellbeing + good health/services)

✅ Economic opportunity (relevant skills + business environment)

✅ Social fabric (cultural vitality + community resilience)

✅ Good governance (clean environment + fair/responsive institutions)


→ They'll want to stay in Sabah


But if any layer is broken:


❌ Poor foundation → "I can't thrive here personally"

❌ Weak economic layer → "There's no future for me here"

❌ Broken social fabric → "This isn't my community anymore"

❌ Bad governance → "This place is going downhill"


→ They'll leave (brain drain)


Revised Framework:


The 8 Core Domains (Inputs):


Personal Wellbeing

Health & Services

Learning & Skills

Economic Opportunity

Cultural Vitality

Community Resilience

Environmental Health

Governance & Justice


The 1 Outcome Indicator:


Place Attachment - "Do people choose to stay and build their lives in Sabah?"


This makes the survey much more powerful because:


Place Attachment becomes the headline metric - like Bhutan's overall GNH score

The 8 domains become diagnostic tools - showing which areas need work to improve retention

Policy becomes clearer - want to stop brain drain? Fix the weakest domains


So the Sabah Holistic Progress Index could be calculated as:


Overall Score: Weighted average of 8 core domains

Retention Indicator: Place Attachment score

Policy Guidance: Gap analysis showing which domains are dragging down retention


This structure answers: "What makes Sabah a place people choose to stay, thrive, and build regenerative futures?"


Much more actionable than treating place attachment as just another domain!

## Response:
Here are the alternative metrics to GDP I found in my research:


National-Level Indices:


1. Bhutan - Gross National Happiness (GNH) Index


9 domains: Living standards, health, education, ecological diversity, cultural diversity, community vitality, time use, psychological wellbeing, good governance

33 indicators total

Score range: 0-1 (2022 score: 0.781)

Unique feature: Constitutional mandate, policy integration


2. OECD Better Life Index


Coverage: 38 countries (35 OECD + 3 non-OECD)

11 domains: Housing, income, jobs, community, education, environment, civic engagement, health, life satisfaction, safety, work-life balance

Interactive feature: Users can weight domains by importance

Visual: Countries shown as flowers with petal sizes


3. Happy Planet Index (HPI)


Coverage: 147+ countries

Formula: (Life expectancy × Wellbeing) / Ecological footprint

Top performers: Vanuatu, Costa Rica, Sweden, El Salvador, Nicaragua

Focus: Environmental efficiency of delivering wellbeing


4. UN Human Development Index (HDI)


3 dimensions: Health (life expectancy), education (schooling years), living standards (GNI per capita)

Global coverage: 191 countries

Limitation: Doesn't capture inequality, empowerment, or environment


Sub-National Examples:


5. US State-Level:


Vermont Genuine Progress Indicator

Maryland Genuine Progress Indicator

Hawaii Genuine Progress Indicator


6. City-Level:


Seattle, Washington - adapted GNH

Somerville, Massachusetts - wellbeing index

Bristol, UK - happiness index

Eau Claire, Wisconsin - GNH version


7. Regional:


São Paulo, Brazil - community-level GNH

Creston, British Columbia - GNH adaptation


Other Metrics Mentioned:


8. Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)


Adjusts GDP by: Environmental costs, income distribution, social factors

26 indicators consolidated

Used by: Several US states


9. Green GDP


Concept: GDP adjusted for environmental damage

Challenge: Developed by China but implementation difficulties

Limitation: Still primarily economic focus


10. Social Progress Index (SPI)


Developer: Social Progress Imperative (2013)

Focus: Social and environmental progress

Comparison: Similar scope to OECD Better Life Index


Key Insights:


Most Comprehensive: Bhutan's GNH (9 domains, 33 indicators, policy integration)


Most Widespread: OECD Better Life Index (38 countries)


Most Environmental: Happy Planet Index (ecological efficiency focus)


Most Participatory: OECD Better Life Index (user weighting) and various city-level adaptations


Most Policy-Integrated: Bhutan's GNH (constitutional mandate, budget allocation)


Sabah's Opportunity: First state-level holistic metric in Southeast Asia addressing post-colonial, resource-extraction context with indigenous values at center.

Based on my research, here are the state/provincial level wellbeing indices I found around the world:


STATE/PROVINCIAL LEVEL WELLBEING INDICES


🇺🇸 UNITED STATES


Vermont Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)

Maryland Genuine Progress Indicator

Hawaii Genuine Progress Indicator

Seattle, Washington - adapted GNH Index with city council integration

Somerville, Massachusetts - happiness index


🇦🇺 AUSTRALIA


SGS Cities & Regions Wellbeing Index (CRWI) - covers 334 regions across Australia with 7 wellbeing domains: health, equality, income/wealth, employment, housing, community/environment

National Wellbeing Dashboard - launched 2023 by federal government with 20 improved indicators, 7 stable, 12 deteriorated


🇬🇧 UNITED KINGDOM


Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD)

Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD)

Bristol Happiness Index (city-level)


🇮🇳 INDIA


State-wise Human Development Index - all Indian states ranked by HDI

SDG India Index 2023-24 - state progress on Sustainable Development Goals

NITI Aayog Health Performance Index - ranking states on health outcomes


🇩🇪 GERMANY


State-wise Human Development Index - German Länder HDI rankings since 1995

Economic performance indices by state (but not comprehensive wellbeing)


🇨🇦 CANADA


Limited explicit provincial wellbeing indices found

Various provincial quality of life reports but not systematic indices


🇧🇷 BRAZIL


São Paulo state - adapted GNH at community level


🇪🇺 EUROPEAN UNION


OECD Regional Well-Being - covers 361 OECD regions including European states/provinces


KEY INSIGHTS:


Most Developed:


Australia's CRWI - most comprehensive state/regional level system

US GPI states - pioneering genuine progress indicators


Most Policy-Integrated:


Australian National Wellbeing Dashboard - federal government adoption

Vermont GPI - legislative mandate for alternative indicators


Most Comprehensive Coverage:


India - systematic state comparisons across multiple indices (HDI, SDG, Health)

Germany - consistent Länder-level HDI tracking


Gaps Identified:


Canada - surprisingly limited provincial wellbeing indices

European regions - mostly rely on OECD framework rather than local development

Most indices focus on outcomes rather than process/agency


SABAH'S OPPORTUNITY:


Sabah would be among the FIRST state-level holistic indices to:


Address post-colonial resource extraction specifically

Center indigenous values (mitatabang) in the framework

Measure "presence vs. participation" (power dynamics)

Focus on brain drain/retention as core outcome

Combine smartphone technology with AI for mass listening


Most existing state indices are either economic variants (GPI) or outcomes-focused (HDI, health rankings). Sabah's approach would be unique in measuring relational wellbeing and regenerative potential at the state level.

## Response:
This is excellent! The visual framework really brings the concept to life. I love how you've shown the flow from problems → layers → specific indicators. A few thoughts on strengthening it:


What's Working Really Well:


Clear problem identification (pink boxes) that directly connects to Sabah's challenges

Logical layer structure with the 8 core domains

Good granularity in the green indicator boxes

Visual hierarchy that shows how everything connects


Potential Additions/Refinements:


Top Section (Problems):


Add "Federal-State Imbalance" - Sabah treated as resource bank rather than partner

Consider "Youth Alienation" - specifically about disconnect from traditional knowledge

Maybe "Infrastructure Gaps" - rural-urban connectivity, digital divide


Indicators to Consider Adding:


Learning & Skills:


"Digital literacy and access"

"Traditional ecological knowledge transmission"


Economic Prospects:


"Access to credit/financing"

"Value-added processing opportunities" (beyond raw material export)


Cultural Vitality:


"Cultural festivals and celebrations participation"

"Respect for elders and traditional authority"


Community Resilience:


"Disaster preparedness and recovery"

"Food sovereignty and local food systems"


Environmental Health:


"Traditional fishing/farming grounds accessibility"

"Community-based conservation practices"


Governance & Justice:


"Land tenure security and customary rights"

"Voice in development planning"


Consider a Connection Layer:


Maybe add arrows or connection lines showing how domains interact? For example:


Cultural Vitality ↔ Community Resilience (strong culture strengthens community)

Learning & Skills ↔ Economic Prospects (relevant education creates opportunities)


Place Attachment Integration:


Since Place Attachment is the outcome synthesis, maybe show it differently - perhaps as a summary box at the bottom that combines elements from all layers?


Questions for Refinement:


Should "Hope for the future" be a separate domain or integrated into Personal Wellbeing?

How will you weight different indicators within each domain?

Will some indicators be more "diagnostic" (showing problems) vs. "aspirational" (showing potential)?


Overall, this framework captures both the crisis and the opportunity beautifully. It shows clearly how the survey would diagnose what's broken while pointing toward regenerative solutions. The visual makes it immediately understandable why this is different from a generic wellbeing survey.

## Response:
This is a fantastic project! Let me summarize your framework and ask some clarifying questions to create the perfect prompt.


Your Framework Summary:


Main Goal: Interactive dashboard for Sabah's Holistic Progress Index with 8 domains, moving beyond GDP to measure regenerative wellbeing and address brain drain.


Core Questions the Dashboard Answers:


"Do I believe change can happen?"

"What will make me stay here?"

"Do I want to stay here & do I have a choice?"


The 8 Domains:


Personal Wellbeing (Purpose in life, Spirituality, Stress Management, Current health status)

Health & Services (Mental Health, Sanitation/Food & Water, Access to healthcare services, Quality of those services)

Learning & Skills (Education, Skills relevant to social needs, Lifelong learning access, General level of education, Digital literacy and access)

Economic Prospects (Employment aspects, Ability to start a local business, Access to market and capital, Diversified livelihood)

Cultural Vitality (Language preservation, Traditional knowledge practices, Intergenerational connection, Tourism activities)

Community Resilience (Mitatabang/community spirit, Social support networks, Trust in strangers within community, Community decision making, Disaster readiness, Local food systems)

Environmental Health (Forest preservation, Clean energy/air/water, Excessive damage to nature in name of progress, Access to natural resources, Sustainable fishing and farming practices)

Governance & Justice (Corruption & transparency, Judicial system for urban and indigenous groups, Political participation and cooperation with community, Incentives to help progress the state as a whole)


Questions to Refine the Prompt:


Data Structure & Visualization:


For the sub-domains, what data types are we working with?


Percentages (e.g., "40% feel purpose")?

Scores 1-10 (e.g., "corruption level 7/10")?

Categories (e.g., education levels)?

Yes/No binaries (e.g., electricity access)?

For the radial charts comparing domains (1-10 scale):


Should each domain score be an average of its sub-domains?

Or a weighted calculation?

Should we show confidence intervals or sample sizes?

District/Geographic Data:


How many districts are we planning for? (All 25 Sabah districts?)

Do we need different chart types for urban vs rural areas?

Should we show geographic maps alongside charts?

Demographics ("By People"):


Age ranges: What brackets? (18-25, 26-40, 41-60, 60+?)

Rural/Urban: How do we define this?

Other demographics: Income level? Ethnicity? Education level?


Chart Type Recommendations:


Which sub-domains need special chart types?


Education levels → Pie chart or stacked bar?

Language preservation → Trend lines over time?

Access to services → Geographic heat maps?

Community trust → Network diagrams?

Comparison Features:


Should users be able to compare 2+ districts side-by-side?

Time-series data: Do we have historical data to show trends?


Interactivity & User Experience:


Navigation Flow:


In "Explore by District" → should users see all villages at once or drill down progressively?

Should there be quick filters (e.g., "Show only rural areas")?

Data Presentation:


Should raw numbers be shown alongside visualizations?

Do we need export/download capabilities?

Should there be explanatory tooltips for each indicator?


Technical Specifications:


shadcn/ui Components:


Are you open to custom chart components beyond shadcn's basic set?

Should we use libraries like Recharts, D3, or Chart.js for complex visualizations?

Responsive Design:


Mobile-first approach for smartphone-based data collection?

Tablet/desktop optimization priorities?


Once I understand these details, I can create a comprehensive prompt that includes:


Complete domain/sub-domain structure

Specific chart recommendations for each data type

Technical requirements for shadcn/ui implementation

User flow specifications

Data visualization best practices for your use case


What are your thoughts on these questions?

## Response:
Perfect! Now I have everything I need. Here are my recommendations for question 2 and chart types:


Domain Scoring Recommendation:


I'd suggest weighted averages rather than simple averages, because some sub-domains are more critical than others. For example:


In Personal Wellbeing: "Purpose in life" might be weighted higher than "Spirituality"

In Economic Prospects: "Access to market and capital" might be weighted higher than "Tourism activities"


But for simplicity with mock data, let's start with simple averages and we can refine later.


Chart Type Recommendations by Sub-Domain:


Personal Wellbeing:


Purpose in life: Progress bar (% who feel purposeful)

Spirituality: Donut chart (levels of spiritual engagement)

Stress Management: Horizontal bar chart (stress levels 1-10)

Current health status: Stacked bar chart (excellent/good/fair/poor)

Education: Stacked bar chart (education levels)

Skills relevant to social needs: Progress bar (% with relevant skills)

Lifelong learning access: Binary indicator (yes/no with %)

General education level: Pie chart (education distribution)

Digital literacy: Progress bar (% digitally literate)


Economic Prospects:


Employment aspects: Multi-metric dashboard (employment rate, job satisfaction)

Ability to start local business: Score bar (1-10 ease of business)

Access to market and capital: Score bar (1-10 access level)

Diversified livelihood: Horizontal bar chart (income source diversity)


Cultural Vitality:


Language preservation: Trend line (language use over generations)

Traditional knowledge: Progress bar (% practicing traditions)

Intergenerational connection: Score visualization (1-10 connection strength)

Tourism activities: Count with trend (number of cultural events/activities)


Community Resilience:


Mitatabang: Progress bar (% feeling community spirit)

Social support networks: Network-style visualization or progress bar (% with strong networks)

Trust in strangers: Simple percentage display with icon

Community decision making: Score bar (1-10 participation level)

Disaster readiness: Progress bar (% prepared)

Local food systems: Score bar (1-10 food security)


Environmental Health:


Forest preservation: Progress bar (% forest coverage maintained)

Clean energy/air/water: Multi-metric card (3 separate scores)

Excessive damage: Reverse score bar (1-10, where 10 = minimal damage)

Access to natural resources: Score bar (1-10 access level)

Sustainable practices: Progress bar (% using sustainable methods)


Governance & Justice:


Corruption & transparency: Score bar (1-10, where 10 = transparent)

Judicial system: Dual score (urban score vs indigenous group score)

Does this capture the complete vision including the visual flow and layout you described?

## Response:
Looking at this prompt critically, I think we're missing some important details that a developer would need. Here are the gaps I see:


Missing Technical Specifications:


Data Structure & State Management:


How should the mock data be structured? (JSON format, data relationships)

State management approach (React Context, Zustand, etc.)

How comparisons should work technically (storing selected items, comparison logic)


Specific UI/UX Behaviors:


Loading states and transitions

Error handling for data

How the domain selection affects the overall radial chart

Mobile navigation patterns (hamburger menu, collapsible sections)

How tooltips should behave (hover vs click on mobile)


Missing Design Specifications:


Visual Design Details:


Color scheme/palette (especially for the 8 domains)

Typography hierarchy

Spacing and layout grid

How the "beautiful illustration of Sabah map" should look

Icon style for domains

Chart color schemes and accessibility


Interaction Design:


Animation/transition styles

How the drill-down breadcrumbs work

What happens when no data is available

Default states (which domain/district is selected first)


Missing Content Details:


Copy and Messaging:


Actual text content for hero section

Explanatory text for each domain

Tooltip content templates

Help text for users


Mock Data Specifications:


Realistic value ranges for each metric

How many districts/cities/villages to include

Sample demographic breakdowns

Edge cases (very high/low performing areas)


Questions to Complete the Picture:


Should I add specific color coding for the 8 domains that carries through the entire interface?

Do you want specific mock data structure examples in the prompt?

Should I specify the component architecture (how pages/components should be organized)?

Do you want accessibility requirements mentioned (screen reader support, keyboard navigation)?

Should I include specific shadcn/ui components to use (Card, Progress, Badge, etc.)?

Do you want the comparison feature to have a maximum number of items (e.g., compare max 3 districts)?

Should there be a search/filter functionality within the district lists?


Would you like me to enhance the prompt with these missing pieces, or do you prefer to keep it high-level and let the developer make these decisions during implementation?
